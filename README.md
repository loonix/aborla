Consuming anything by itself is not a problem. Consumption is necessary and works as a basis for survival of any and all species. When breathing, we consume air; to be hydrated, we consume water; to survive and stay healthy, we need to feed ourselves. This is transversal to all species that cohabit with us on this wonderful planet called Earth. They are natural acts that have always existed and that we need to keep us alive.

The problem is precisely here, to manage to drain and reuse in a balanced way all the result of this exaggerated and impulsive consumption that leads us to use, not use and throw away. When putting in the trash, we are introducing materials of all kinds (plastic, glass, aluminium, paper, fabrics, rubber etc.) in this circuit. This practice can be avoided by promoting its exchange or even sale for residual values.

The purpose of this platform is to promote the exchange of goods, reuse, avoid waste and capitalize on solidarity with the most disadvantaged.

Recover, Reduce, Reuse, Recycle. Why destroy what can be reused?
Reuse what at first seems no longer usable.
